# Background

For this project, I was interested in identifying the causes of motor vehicle collisions in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania

#### Data Analysis & Visualization Tools
+ Python
+ SQL
+ Tableau Public
+ Microsoft Excel

#### For this project, I analyzed data from Pennsylvania's Department of Transportation and created an interactive Tableau dashboard to share my insights.  

+ First, I utilized Python to perform reverse geocoding to extract location data using the Nominatim geocoding service.
+ Next, I imported the data into Postgresql and executed SQL queries to analyze the data.
+ I created an interactive Tableau dashboard to visualize and share my insights.
