# Background

For this case study, I was tasked with analyzing motor vehicle collisions in Philadelphia, PA from January 2015 - December 2020 and provide recommendations on how to reduce the occurrence of motor vehicle collisions within Philadelphia. 

# Data Source

The dataset is comprised of 67,333 reportable crash incidents and may be accessed [here](https://pennshare.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=8fdbf046e36e41649bbfd9d7dd7c7e7e).

#### Data Analysis & Visualization Tools
+ Python
+ SQL

#### For this project, I analyzed data from Pennsylvania's Department of Transportation and created an interactive Tableau dashboard to share my insights.  

+ First, I utilized Python to perform reverse geocoding to extract location data using the Nominatim geocoding service.
+ Next, I imported the data into Postgresql and executed SQL queries to analyze the data.
+ I created an interactive Tableau dashboard to visualize and share my insights.
